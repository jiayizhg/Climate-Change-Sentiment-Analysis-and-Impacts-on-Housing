      "The winners of this particular lawsuit are all the attorneys that have made millions and millions of dollars throughout the years of litigation. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumers should take time to interview several agents and find a great one - they're out there and worth every penny according to the consumers who hired someone great. Clicking \"show me this house\" button is the WORST way to find an agent. Like any successful project, preparation is key to a great result. \n",
      "\n",
      "The industry as a whole is overwhelmed by poorly trained and poorly supervised agents. IMO this is because all the associations want as many licensees as possible in order to fill their coffers with agent fees. So, they make it super easy to get a license, extremely difficult to file complaints, and it's almost unheard of for a licensee to lose their license (YMMV by state). \n",
      "\n",
      "Public perception is that being an agent is super easy - which it is for unskilled, untrained agents, to the detriment of the consumers who choose to hire this type of agent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fees and commissions have always been negotiable. The lawsuits aren't going to change anything, except maybe provide some transparency on the buyer's agent side of things. Our local MLS has already started publishing the information to the public (used to be hidden from consumers), and they now allow $0 for buyer's agent compensation, it used to be a $1 minimum. Nothing has changed. \n",
      "\n",
      "No one \"needs\" to hire an agent, if a consumer doesn't value the services provided by experienced professionals, then they shouldn't hire one. Just like anyone can change their own oil, cut their own hair, paint their own house and any number of other tasks that people choose to hire pros to assist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently heard a good explanation regarding the value of agents (and many different types of professionals) around \"the last mile\". The Last Mile is the most difficult part of any transaction and logistics issue - it's easy to get stuff from a manufacturer to a warehouse, the most costly and difficult part of the supply chain is getting that stuff into the consumers home. [Here's a link to the podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mdelprete/episodes/Orly-Ripmaster-The-Business-of-Brokerage-e29341v/a-aab5bh2), a good listen for anyone interested in the RE biz, but created for an agent audience, so some of it may not make sense to a layperson. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "*IMO there are 3 elements that would change the industry to better serve consumers:*\n",
      "\n",
      "1. *It should be harder to become an agent, and brokers should be held to a higher standard of training and supervision.* \n",
      "2. *Consumers should be better informed about what makes a good-great agent. Hint: it's not the act of passing an incredibly easy test and obtaining a license. Stop hiring shitty agents - they'll go away if no one hires them.* \n",
      "3. *Fees will be limited to what the consumer market will bear. Consumers get to choose the service level they want, and how much they want to pay. You can buy a black tshirt from Walmart for $8 that'll last through 3 washes, or you can buy a black tshirt from Nordstrom for $30 that'll last through 2 seasons. Quality matters.*   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Last note - the sites the u/shortwoman refers to as 'funnels' are definitely used to collect and sell information to agents (because The Last Mile) but they're also massive data collection sites. They've become expert at monetizing the data, especially through acquisition of adjacent products like ShowingTime and DotLoop. The amount of consumer and industry data collected there is worth billions.\n",
      "The only thing that might make agents obsolete, is if consumers had to pay them out of pocket. The ability to pay them out of the sale proceeds (and, the buyers then essentially paying that fee over 30 years plus interest) makes it too easy for all involved. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think that will change though, too much lobbying going on from realtors and banks.\n",
      "The Pax Americana of 2024 began when economists finally stopped questioning the realtor-broker real estate model. In fact, they realized that they had it opposite all all along: a 6% commission system was, in fact, the most efficient economic practice. The reason it had persisted for decades was simply because it was the most efficient, optimal means of bartering in a healthy economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hans reflected on these developments as he sat down to eat his footlong hoagie. However, before he could dig in, a woman wearing a red blazer appeared from under his table. She snatched the sub and carefully took a 0.72 inch bite from the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Date the prosciutto, marry the gabagool*, she hissed between bites.\n",
      "These types of discussions sort of irk me, as the question if are underpaid or they are overpaid implies they are only 2 states: overpaid or underpaid  I believe they are not correctly paid: some properly paid, some underpaid, many possibly over paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 6% (give or take a little) commission, is hold over from decades when there was no technology, housing prices were lower and the realtor had to actually walk the streets to find data, information and houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today a lot of the information and work is automated.  The physical, manual and intellectual effort to sell at $350,000 house is not to much more (or possibly less) than a $1 million house.  Yet there is an almost near one size fits all approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes people will argue you can sell it yourself, you can negotiate with a broker, you can .....  but the reality is that the system is stacked against the small single home buyer or seller.  Small changes will make a difference.  If I can list my home on MLS (with a small fee) without going through a broker, guess how many brokers will go out of business.  Then one may argue, why does not someone create a parallel MLS.  It is not easy and MLS has used every legal loophole to prevent that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some home buyers and sellers may need a lot of hand holding, for others, with less than a few hours of work on part of the brokers and realtors, the house sells itself.  Why do I pay the same fee.  So we need to make sure buyers and sellers have a level playing field.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR:  The one size fits all compensation model pushed by realtors has removed the relationship between effort the realtor puts in and how much the realtor gets paid.  Hence realtors may be underpaid in some cases, but they are grossly overpaid in others.\n",
      "I would like to see a survey that asks customers how they feel about agent commissions. I'm willing to bet there is a good balance that think commissions should be lower(1-3%, or less), are ok with the 5-6%, or don't care. Personally I think agents are dumb as hell and are not worth the commissions they are paid. But at the same time there shouldn't be a law that caps them on what they can earn. If you got charged a higher commission fee and complain about it then you are just as pathetic as the agents. You are pathetic because you are scared to say no to their commission rates. No one forces anyone to do anything. There is a shit load of agents out there you can find for 4% or less or even a flat fee. The work will all be the same.         \n",
      "\n",
      "I will say this. The ones that are truly worth the higher commission are the agents that handle foreclosure properties. They get a shit load of tasks to complete that come with short deadlines. They have to front for expenses that can easily go in the thousands and not get reimbursed until 4-6 weeks. All this before the property is even ready to market. And when the house is for sale you still have to babysit the property. And then you have to deal with the dumbass agent representing the buyer. A lot of work goes into it and the banks don't pay 6%. I've seen as low as 1% or a flat fee of about $1500. Normally somewhere between 4-5%. Those guys truly earn the commission.\n",
      "If agents are overpaid and it's such an easy way to make money, why aren't all the complainers running out to get their real estate licenses? If you are altruistic and want to help people, you can charge less than the big agencies. It's super simple to get your license, what's stopping you? \n",
      "\n",
      "I do think the downward pressure on fees is good, but, even 20 years ago I wasn't paying 6%. That's always been negotiable.\n",
      "My 2c - \n",
      "\n",
      "if anyone feels that they don't need an agent / having to pay more - they have a choice. They don't HAVE to use an agent if they don't want to (FSBO or direct buyer or use an attorney yadda yadda).\n",
      "\n",
      "If any agent feels they are underpaid / can't get enough - they have a choice of continuing or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess it's a lot easier to point the finger elsewhere than to take responsibility for choices..\n",
      "Current minimum buyer's agent compensation in most MLSs: $1\n",

      "You're over-thinking it. Determine valuation using current metrics, and disregard any previous transactions....they're history. Stop trying to get into the head of the Seller. Figure out what you're willing to pay and make an offer. Be willing to move on if the Seller balks.\n",

      "Its current value. They might not be able to sell below, but thats nobreason to pver pay. A bunch of people did that. Now they are stuck. This is why houding prices will fall. Offer away. it's been on the market for a while. Only give them 24 hours to answer. If you dont get a counter, DONT negotiate against yourself.\n",
      "It does happen.  We bought our house for about 85k less then the seller paid for it.\n",
      "I’m saying this from an investor point of view but if the numbers don’t add up, it’s not worth pursuing and move onto the next. That being said, it never hurts to throw an offer that is reasonable in terms of the numbers you run and worse thing is no.\n",
      "\n",
      "Work with your realtor on this but you can always negotiate after inspecting the property and that way, if you find certain things are not adding up, gives you more power to negotiate.

      "Worked in the Bay Area during the Dot Com bust and Housing Crash, had coworkers sell for nearly half what they paid.\n",

      "As a suggestion, do a little research and try and find out why the person selling it is so anxious to get out. Make sure you build an inspection into your offer, so in case there's major work needed you're aware of it and have the option to drop the offer.\n",

In fact, a simple conversation between your agent and the listing agent presenting those comps will make your offer appear reasonable. Aside from the comps, I would still advise no matter what to submit the offer. Perhaps they come back with a counter and through negotiation you can find out their bottom line. \n",

      "It’s not offensive. People paid well over appraised values for these home—and that’s their own fault. \n",
      "They cannot create value by overpaying for something. This is the problem with prices now and the artificial prices paid and now being listed. The next-greater-fool has left the building and now people will have to realize their mistakes.

There was no interest in the property, and way too many homes for sale then. Plus had tenants in it. Owners just wanted to sell and move interstate. Property had been on market for 4 months. They did repairs asked for by building inspectors, which wasnt much. Building inspectors were great, climbing in ceiling and checking cyclone code compliances. Tenants were financially helped to move by the owners, as well. Sale price was $50k under what they had purchased it for, but they got their money and moved. House is fine, structurally great and cyclone coded. Mortgage is cheaper by hundreds each month than current rents here at present. Definitely try it and see, they can say no but they may accept. Do get building and electrical inspections. Good luck\n",

      "It is not offensive. It is just reality. We lost $70,000 on our last house. It didn't feel like that because we had paid down the mortgage and refinanced because of an inheritance, so we walked away with a little money in our pocket but the truth was that we lost money. I had friends 30 years ago who had to take $20,000 to closing to sell their house and another friend now who will pay to sell if office condo because people don't need to work in offices any more.

We just sold a place and are in the process of buying one, and one thing that I have learned is when the internet rates started going up, a lot of sellers were ending up giving back lot of money at closing, so that the buyers could buy down their interest rate, so the \"sale price\" could be hugely inflated as you see it. \n",

      "This would also be an opportunity for your agent to lightly touch on where you were looking to be by asking questions like \"does your seller have any offers in-hand? Have they declined any offers? How motivated is the seller to where they would consider an offer below their current asking price?\" etc.\n",
      "If they are in a pinch to offload house it doesn’t matter. Should have thought before having fomo and buying overpriced house. No one is entitled to enrich themselves via housing market\n",
      "Sadly, there's really no guarantee that a home will gain value. Certainly no guarantee it'll do so in any specific timeframe.

      "Also can’t hurt to know your comps in the area. A touch under comps will give wiggle room\n",

Also, don't assume their mortgage is higher than what You're offering. If they put 10% down then they had less in their mortgage than you're offering.\n",

      "Navigating through the intricacies of real estate offers, especially in a situation like the one you've described, can indeed be a delicate matter. Offering below what a seller originally paid for their home isn't inherently offensive, but it does require a strategic approach and a thorough understanding of the current market conditions.  \n",
      "In the scenario you've outlined, where the home has seen multiple owners within a short span and has undergone several price reductions, your inclination to offer below the current asking price seems justified, especially considering the increasing inventory in that price range.   \n",
      "Making an offer is always a balance between doing what is right for the buyer's situation and trying to offer something that will be accepted by the seller. Here are a few thoughts:  \n",
      "1. \\*\\*Understanding the Seller's Position\\*\\*: \"Motivated seller\" could indeed imply a willingness to negotiate and perhaps even to sell at a loss, but it's crucial to approach this with empathy and understanding. They might be in a tight spot and willing to negotiate, but it's also possible that there's a limit to how low they can go.  \n",
      "2. \\*\\*Analyzing the Market\\*\\*: It's vital to consider the broader market conditions. If inventory is building up in this price range, it indicates that you, as a buyer, might have more leverage in negotiations.   \n",
      "3. \\*\\*Your Offer\\*\\*: Offering $410,000 in the context you've provided doesn’t seem unreasonable, but it's essential to ensure that this number is backed by comparable sales and current market conditions. If comps and other market data justify this price point, it strengthens your position.  \n",
      "4. \\*\\*Seller’s Financial Situation\\*\\*: While it might be hard to believe, yes, some homeowners do end up paying to sell their house, especially if they’re in a situation where they need to sell quickly. This could be due to a variety of reasons like a job relocation, personal circumstances, or other financial reasons.  \n",
      "5. \\*\\*Emotional Quotient\\*\\*: Real estate transactions are not just financial but also emotional. Acknowledging the seller's position and approaching the situation with respect and understanding can sometimes pave the way for smoother negotiations.  \n",
      "6. \\*\\*Professional Guidance\\*\\*: Engaging with a knowledgeable realtor, as you've done, who can navigate through these negotiations while respecting both parties' positions is crucial.  \n",
      "In conclusion, your offer should ultimately reflect what you believe the home is worth based on market data and what you're comfortable paying. It's always worthwhile to present an offer that is justifiable and aligns with your financial and living situation. If the seller is indeed motivated and if your offer is backed by solid market data, you might find yourselves reaching a mutually agreeable resolution.  \n",

We loved the last house we saw but it was simply out of our price range. We opted for a last ditch effort before officially calling it quits and offered 40k under ask. The sellers initially countered 10k under asking price but we just couldn’t get there. We understood and thanked them for their time so imagine our surprise 2 days later when they circled back and accepted our initial offer with the understanding they would not repair anything, offer concessions or reduce the price. They were relocating and just didn’t want to deal with selling while out of state. All that to say, it can happen. The worst that happens is they say no.\n",

The first sale is always the og home owner who was in it for 20 years, then a flipper bought it and painted it black and listed it for double a year later, then someone bought it and lived in it for a year then realized they could cash out on it and sold it to some who thought it would be a good rental property and that didn’t work and now they need to dump it. In my area the last buyer is usually someone trying to rent but the rent prices somehow are not proportionate with actual home prices so alot of people bought to rent out to college kids and now they are losing money. The house next to mine is on Redfin for 700k right now but is being rented for 1900$. I honestly don’t know how that works can someone explain?

That's more than just the listing of homes for sale. We don't believe that we've been building enough homes over the course of the past fifteen years. I can be conservative with my assumptions and get to roughly a two million unit shortage. I can be more aggressive and say that we might be six million units shy. We think that the truth lies somewhere in that range. And by the way, that's a total of single unit and multi unit housing. But that shortage should theory be a tailwind in a world in which maybe not affordability starts improving, but at least the marginal volatility in that metric comes right or maybe it stabilizes so that people can at least make, you know, decisions about their longer term finances.”\n",

The reason demand declined in 2006 was that there were not enough gen x adults born to have the need to buy the then existing home inventory. So you had builders who made homes thinking there would be a steady stream of buyers. But those people never existed. Now you have a huge number of millennials that are ready to buy and those numbers increase daily. The issue is that home builders stopped building, so there is no ready supply. Then there are the boomers. They are not going to leave their single family homes. Why you may ask, they saw the lock downs in the senior care centers. Where they knew the silent gen were not allowed to leave. They watched a lot of their parents die in those care homes. They also see the prices. They either have paid off homes, or refinanced into 3% or less mortgages. They know they will pay more for a smaller home. Why would they want to do that? No. They will tap into the equity to make their homes age in place friendly. They will just not use some of the rooms. Or they will say I could let my grandchildren live with me. Those homes are in prime locations. They will eventually go to their gen x and millennial children. Those children will either move into mom and dad’s home as a means to upgrade their current living situation or take the paid off home and turn it into a rental.\n",

I unfortunately did qualify for a $3800 mortgage on a $850k but kept getting beat by higher offers so I stopped trying to buy...\n",
      "> Before I move on I also need to mention the emotional climate in the U.S. post 2008. People were scared to buy homes. They were very hesitant to be upside down on incase anything like 2008 happened again. This created low demand that stretched really all the way to 2018-2019 when people started to realize--\"hey interest rates aren't that bad, economy is good, it seems more affordable to own than rent\". The the lack of supply wasn't being felt by the greater population until 2020 hit and things got turned upside down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe this to be a factor as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doomers talk about future demand being pulled forward to 2020 and 2021, but I think it was as much about demand being tempered by people hesitant about real estate post-2008 that also played a big role. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do I think some people who might have bought in 2023 instead bought in 2021? Sure. But I also think that some people opted not to buy in 2016 or 2018 or 2019, because they thought prices would be coming down, and then when they saw rates drop and prices doing the opposite of coming down, they finally decided to stop hesitating.\n",

      "Consumers should take time to interview several agents and find a great one - they're out there and worth every penny according to the consumers who hired someone great. Clicking \"show me this house\" button is the WORST way to find an agent. Like any successful project, preparation is key to a great result. \n",
      "\n",
      "The industry as a whole is overwhelmed by poorly trained and poorly supervised agents. IMO this is because all the associations want as many licensees as possible in order to fill their coffers with agent fees. So, they make it super easy to get a license, extremely difficult to file complaints, and it's almost unheard of for a licensee to lose their license (YMMV by state). \n",
      "\n",
      "Public perception is that being an agent is super easy - which it is for unskilled, untrained agents, to the detriment of the consumers who choose to hire this type of agent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fees and commissions have always been negotiable. The lawsuits aren't going to change anything, except maybe provide some transparency on the buyer's agent side of things. Our local MLS has already started publishing the information to the public (used to be hidden from consumers), and they now allow $0 for buyer's agent compensation, it used to be a $1 minimum. Nothing has changed. \n",

      "No one \"needs\" to hire an agent, if a consumer doesn't value the services provided by experienced professionals, then they shouldn't hire one. Just like anyone can change their own oil, cut their own hair, paint their own house and any number of other tasks that people choose to hire pros to assist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently heard a good explanation regarding the value of agents (and many different types of professionals) around \"the last mile\". The Last Mile is the most difficult part of any transaction and logistics issue - it's easy to get stuff from a manufacturer to a warehouse, the most costly and difficult part of the supply chain is getting that stuff into the consumers home. [Here's a link to the podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mdelprete/episodes/Orly-Ripmaster-The-Business-of-Brokerage-e29341v/a-aab5bh2), a good listen for anyone interested in the RE biz, but created for an agent audience, so some of it may not make sense to a layperson. \n",

      "*IMO there are 3 elements that would change the industry to better serve consumers:*\n",
      "\n",
      "1. *It should be harder to become an agent, and brokers should be held to a higher standard of training and supervision.* \n",
      "2. *Consumers should be better informed about what makes a good-great agent. Hint: it's not the act of passing an incredibly easy test and obtaining a license. Stop hiring shitty agents - they'll go away if no one hires them.* \n",
      "3. *Fees will be limited to what the consumer market will bear. Consumers get to choose the service level they want, and how much they want to pay. You can buy a black tshirt from Walmart for $8 that'll last through 3 washes, or you can buy a black tshirt from Nordstrom for $30 that'll last through 2 seasons. Quality matters.*   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Last note - the sites the u/shortwoman refers to as 'funnels' are definitely used to collect and sell information to agents (because The Last Mile) but they're also massive data collection sites. They've become expert at monetizing the data, especially through acquisition of adjacent products like ShowingTime and DotLoop. The amount of consumer and industry data collected there is worth billions.\n",
      "The only thing that might make agents obsolete, is if consumers had to pay them out of pocket. The ability to pay them out of the sale proceeds (and, the buyers then essentially paying that fee over 30 years plus interest) makes it too easy for all involved. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think that will change though, too much lobbying going on from realtors and banks.\n",
      "The Pax Americana of 2024 began when economists finally stopped questioning the realtor-broker real estate model. In fact, they realized that they had it opposite all all along: a 6% commission system was, in fact, the most efficient economic practice. The reason it had persisted for decades was simply because it was the most efficient, optimal means of bartering in a healthy economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hans reflected on these developments as he sat down to eat his footlong hoagie. However, before he could dig in, a woman wearing a red blazer appeared from under his table. She snatched the sub and carefully took a 0.72 inch bite from the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Date the prosciutto, marry the gabagool*, she hissed between bites.\n",
      "These types of discussions sort of irk me, as the question if are underpaid or they are overpaid implies they are only 2 states: overpaid or underpaid  I believe they are not correctly paid: some properly paid, some underpaid, many possibly over paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 6% (give or take a little) commission, is hold over from decades when there was no technology, housing prices were lower and the realtor had to actually walk the streets to find data, information and houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today a lot of the information and work is automated.  The physical, manual and intellectual effort to sell at $350,000 house is not to much more (or possibly less) than a $1 million house.  Yet there is an almost near one size fits all approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes people will argue you can sell it yourself, you can negotiate with a broker, you can .....  but the reality is that the system is stacked against the small single home buyer or seller.  Small changes will make a difference.  If I can list my home on MLS (with a small fee) without going through a broker, guess how many brokers will go out of business.  Then one may argue, why does not someone create a parallel MLS.  It is not easy and MLS has used every legal loophole to prevent that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some home buyers and sellers may need a lot of hand holding, for others, with less than a few hours of work on part of the brokers and realtors, the house sells itself.  Why do I pay the same fee.  So we need to make sure buyers and sellers have a level playing field.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR:  The one size fits all compensation model pushed by realtors has removed the relationship between effort the realtor puts in and how much the realtor gets paid.  Hence realtors may be underpaid in some cases, but they are grossly overpaid in others.\n",
      "I would like to see a survey that asks customers how they feel about agent commissions. I'm willing to bet there is a good balance that think commissions should be lower(1-3%, or less), are ok with the 5-6%, or don't care. Personally I think agents are dumb as hell and are not worth the commissions they are paid. But at the same time there shouldn't be a law that caps them on what they can earn. If you got charged a higher commission fee and complain about it then you are just as pathetic as the agents. You are pathetic because you are scared to say no to their commission rates. No one forces anyone to do anything. There is a shit load of agents out there you can find for 4% or less or even a flat fee. The work will all be the same.         \n",
      "\n",
      "I will say this. The ones that are truly worth the higher commission are the agents that handle foreclosure properties. They get a shit load of tasks to complete that come with short deadlines. They have to front for expenses that can easily go in the thousands and not get reimbursed until 4-6 weeks. All this before the property is even ready to market. And when the house is for sale you still have to babysit the property. And then you have to deal with the dumbass agent representing the buyer. A lot of work goes into it and the banks don't pay 6%. I've seen as low as 1% or a flat fee of about $1500. Normally somewhere between 4-5%. Those guys truly earn the commission.\n",
      "If agents are overpaid and it's such an easy way to make money, why aren't all the complainers running out to get their real estate licenses? If you are altruistic and want to help people, you can charge less than the big agencies. It's super simple to get your license, what's stopping you? \n",
      "\n",
      "I do think the downward pressure on fees is good, but, even 20 years ago I wasn't paying 6%. That's always been negotiable.\n",
      "My 2c - \n",
      "\n",
      "if anyone feels that they don't need an agent / having to pay more - they have a choice. They don't HAVE to use an agent if they don't want to (FSBO or direct buyer or use an attorney yadda yadda).\n",
      "\n",
      "If any agent feels they are underpaid / can't get enough - they have a choice of continuing or not.\n",
      "\n",
